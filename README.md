# Pokemon Battle Simulation

## Overview

This project simulates battles between Pokemon of different types, specifically Fire and Electric types. The program allows two players to battle against each other, with each player being assigned a random Pokemon. The battle proceeds in turns, where players can choose to attack, wait, evolve their Pokemon, or perform special actions.

## Features

- **Simulate battles between Fire and Electric type Pokemon**
- **Random assignment of Pokemon to players**
- **Turn-based battle system with various actions available (attack, wait, evolve, special actions)**
- **Calculation of damage based on Pokemon types and attack types**
- **Evolution of Pokemon with specific conditions and costs**
- **Special abilities for Fire and Electric type Pokemon**
- **Display of current battle status, including Pokemon health and attack points**

## Pokemon Types

### Fire Type Pokemon
- Charmander (Evolves to Charmeleon and Charizard)
- Salandit (Evolves to Salazzle)
- Moltres (No evolution)

### Electric Type Pokemon
- Pichu (Evolves to Pikachu and Raichu)
- Blitzle (Evolves to Zebstrika)
- Electabuzz (Evolves to Electivire)

## Battle Mechanics

- **Attack**: Players can choose from a list of available attacks for their Pokemon. Attacks have different costs and damage ranges.
- **Wait**: Players can choose to wait for a turn, gaining bonuses like health recovery, attack power increase, or triple attack power for the next turn.
- **Evolve**: If the Pokemon can evolve, players can pay a cost in health and attack points to evolve their Pokemon to a higher level.
- **Special Action**: Fire type Pokemon can perform two consecutive attacks but lose 50% health and reset attack points. Electric type Pokemon can fully restore their health and attack points (once per battle).
